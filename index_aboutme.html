    <h1>About My Recycling Project</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            In today's world, the improper disposal of waste, particularly electronic waste, poses a significant environmental challenge. Many people are unaware of the correct ways to recycle various items, leading to increased landfill waste and potential environmental hazards.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">
            The core problem is the lack of easily accessible, user-friendly information on proper recycling practices, especially for complex items like electronics.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
        <p>
            To address this issue, I am developing a web-based application that provides clear, concise information on how to recycle different types of items, with a special focus on electronic waste.
        </p>
        <p>
            Key features of the solution include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>An intuitive interface for users to quickly find recycling information for specific items</li>
            <li>Detailed categorization of recyclable and non-recyclable electronics</li>
            <li>Visual guides and clear instructions for proper disposal methods</li>
            <li>Information on local recycling centers and e-waste collection points</li>
            <li>Educational content on the importance of responsible recycling</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="highlight">
            By providing this information in an easily accessible format, the project aims to increase awareness and encourage proper recycling practices, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable environment.

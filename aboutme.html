        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            In Singapore, senior citizens find it difficult to understand which materials can be recycled, causing confusion and improper disposal of waste at residential estates. <strong>This results in an increase in non-recyclable items being placed in recycling bins.</strong> This is important because it undermines Singapore's sustainability initiatives and hampers progress toward the nation's goal of becoming zero-waste. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Proposed Web Application</h2>
        <p>
            To address the recycling confusion faced by senior citizens in Singapore, <strong>I have developed a user-friendly web application designed to provide clear, accessible recycling information.</strong> This web app will enable senior citizens to understand which items are recyclable, thereby reducing waste contamination and contributing positively to Singapore's sustainability goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Key features include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>An intuitive interface for senior citizens to quickly find recycling information for specific items</li>
            <li>Clear categorization of recyclable and non-recyclable items</li>
            <li>Information on the type of recycling bins to use for recyclable items</li>
            <li>Multi-language support</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="highlight">
            By providing this information in an easily accessible format, the project aims to increase awareness and encourage proper recycling practices, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable environment.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          As a participant in the <strong>TechUp 3.0</strong> programme, I've embarked on the journey of developing this web application even though I have no formal background in Computer Engineering or Computer Science. This project represents my commitment to learning and adapting to new technologies, showcasing the potential for individuals from diverse backgrounds to contribute to the tech industry.

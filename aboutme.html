    <h1>About My Recycling Web Application</h1>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p class="highlight">
            In Singapore, senior citizens find it difficult to understand which materials can be recycled, causing confusion and improper disposal of waste at residential estates. <strong>This results in an increase in non-recyclable items being placed in recycling bins.</strong> This is important because it undermines Singapore's sustainability initiatives and hampers progress toward the nation's goal of becoming zero-waste. 
        </p>
        <h2>Initial Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>
            My initial hypothesis assumed a general lack of awareness about recyclables across all demographics in Singapore. However, user interviews conducted have revealed a more nuanced reality. These interviews highlighted that the confusion surrounding recyclables is particularly acute among senior citizens, especially those who are less proficient in English or less comfortable with technology. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While there are available resources such as NEA's website, info guides in PDF files, AI bots, and WhatsApp & Telegram chatbots for inquiring about the recyclability of items, these tools often prove too complex for seniors to navigate effectively. <strong>They struggle to leverage existing digital resources, finding them overwhelming or inaccessible.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>As a result, the challenge isn't just about providing information, but about making that information easily accessible and understandable for a population that may be linguistically or technologically disadvantaged. This insight has led me to focus the web application on addressing the unique needs of senior citizens in understanding and participating in Singapore's recycling efforts.</strong>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Proposed Web Application</h2>
        <p>
            To address the recycling confusion faced by senior citizens in Singapore, I have developed an intuitive, user-friendly web application specifically tailored for senior citizens.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Key features include:</u>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multilingual Interface:</strong> The web application is available in both English and Chinese, addressing the language barrier many seniors face with existing resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual Recognition:</strong> Users can easily identify recyclable and non-recyclable items through clear, high-contrast images.</li>
            <li><strong>Simple Navigation:</strong> Large buttons and a straightforward layout ensure ease of use for those less familiar with technology.</li>
            <li><strong>Categorized Information:</strong> Items are grouped into clear categories like 'Recyclable' and 'Non-Recyclable', making it easier for users to find specific information.</li>
            <li><strong>Detailed Instructions:</strong> For each item, the web application provides clear, concise information about proper recycling or disposal methods.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="highlight">
            By presenting recycling information in a simple, intuitive format tailored for senior citizens, this web application aims to bridge the knowledge gap and address the specific challenges faced by seniors, making proper recycling practices more accessible and encouraging their active involvement in creating a more sustainable environment.
